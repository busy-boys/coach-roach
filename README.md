# UNTITLED PROJECT 2

[![Deploy dokku](https://github.com/busy-boys/project-2/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/busy-boys/project-2/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Brances

- main: this will be used the same as last project. This should be the working version with merges made to this branch when an issue/task is fixed/finished.
- deploy: this is set to automatically update the server after a PR/merge to this branch.This will be done when we are happy with the state of main and we can then PR main over to deploy. This should help us avoid breaking changes from ending up on the live version of the site.

## Linting Setup

I have included all the config files in the repo so you should just be able to:

1. make sure you have the appropriate extensions installed

- esLint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- prettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- better Comments: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments
- Spell Right: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright

2. Clone the repo down.
3. check you have 2 ticks next to esLint and prettier in bottom right of vsCode (you might have to hit allow, or click on esLint and click allow)
4. get lint'n with it ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ.

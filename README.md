# UNTITLED PROJECT 2

## Linting Setup

I have included all the config files in the repo so you should just be able to:

1. make sure you have the appropriate extensions installed

- esLint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- prettier: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode

2. Clone the repo down.
3. check you have 2 ticks next to esLint and prettier in bottom right of vsCode
4. get lint'n with it ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ.
